**Project Name:  E-commerce Django web app**

**Description**

This Django web application provides a robust e-commerce platform for managing your online store. It offers user-friendly interfaces for both administrators and customers, enabling seamless product management, order processing, and customer interaction.

**Key Features**

* **Intuitive Dashboard:** Administrators have access to a dedicated dashboard that presents an overview of essential store metrics, such as sales performance, product popularity, and customer trends. This empowers data-driven decision-making.
* **Secure Login System:** Secure login pages are provided for both administrators and users, ensuring user authentication and authorization. Role-based access control ensures only authorized users can perform specific actions.
* **User Roles:** The application supports two primary user roles:
    * **Admin:** Has full access to manage products, orders, users, and website content.
    * **User:** Can browse products, add items to their cart, place orders, and view their order history.

**Installation**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.x (check with `python --version`)
   - pip (check with `pip --version`)
2. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://[your_repository_url].git
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure database:**

   - Create a database (refer to Django's documentation for specific instructions).
   - Update `settings.py` with your database credentials.

6. **Migrate database:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   This will start the server, usually accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ by default.

**Usage**

* **Admin Panel:** Access the admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ (replace with your server address if different). Use the default Django admin credentials (username: `admin`, password: `password`) or create your own.
* **User Login:** Users can navigate to the login page (URL will depend on your project setup) and use their account credentials to log in.
